# hole_drilling_code

The code is for an automated hole drilling machine that I developed as part of 
initiative to create technology for rural artisans. The holes were drilled as
part of the larger process of making bamboo pens. The machine was used for 
drilling holes to make the caps of the pens.

The machine clampled a piece of round bamboo stock(10mm diameter) and then a 
drilling head drilled the hole. The next piece would them be loaded 
automatically and the process would carry on.
