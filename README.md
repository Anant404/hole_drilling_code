# hole_drilling_code

The code is for an automated hole drilling machine that I developed as a part
of the last venture. The holes were drilled as part of the larger process of
making bamboo pens. The machine was used for drilling holes to make the 
caps of the pens.

The machine clampled a piece of round bamboo stock(10mm diameter) and then a 
drilling head drilled the hole. The next piece would them be loaded 
automatically and the process would carry on.
